# BookYourMovie
The main objective of the project is to create an Online Movie Ticket Booking system that allows customers to know about new movies, their schedules, cinema locations, ticket price, ratings etc. The user will be able to search for movies, theatres and slots in order to book tickets. Users will be able to download  tickets and invoice and will be notified through mail when the booking is confirmed. The user can rate the movies and theatres. This project will be able to recommend movies based on other users' preferences who have watched the given movie before.
This project will be using Kafka for the notification system. This project will be using Elasticsearch for finding movies accurately and efficiently.
The Administrator will have the option to add, update any theatre/movie. Likewise he/she can add/delete slots and can also view all movie ratings given by users.
